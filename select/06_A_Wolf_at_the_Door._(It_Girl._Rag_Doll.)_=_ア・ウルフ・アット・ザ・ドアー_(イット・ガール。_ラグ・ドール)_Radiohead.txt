Drag him out your window, dragging out the dead
Singing I miss you, snakes and ladders
Flip the lid, out pops the cracker
Snaps you in the head, knifes you in the neck
Kicks you in the teeth, steel toe caps
Takes all your credit cards, get up, get the gunge

Get the eggs, get the flan in the face
The flan in the face, the flan in the face
Dance you fucker, dance you fucker
Don't you dare, don't you dare
Don't you flan in the face
Take it with the love it's given
Take it with a pinch of salt
Take it to the tax-man

Let me back, let me back, I promise to be good
Don't look in the mirror at the face you don't recognize
Help me call the doctor, put me inside
Put me inside, put me inside
Put me inside, put me inside

I keep the wolf from the door
But he calls me up, calls me on the phone
Tells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up
Steal all my children if I don't pay the ransom
But I'll never see 'em again if I squeal to the cops

Walking like giant cranes
Ah, with my X-ray eyes I strip you naked
In a tight little world, why are you on the list?
Step forwards, who are we to complain?
Investments and dealers, investments and dealers
Cold wives and mistresses, cold wives and Sunday papers

City boys in first class don't know they're born, they don't
Someone else is going to come and clean it up
Born and raised for the job, someone always does
I wish you'd get up, get over, get up, get over
Turn your tape off

I keep the wolf from the door
But he calls me up, calls me on the phone
Tells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up
Steal all my children if I don't pay the ransom
And I'll never see 'em again if I squeal to the cops
So, I'm just gonna, ah, ah-ah
